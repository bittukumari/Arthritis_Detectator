# Arthritis_Detectator
The Arthritis Detector Project is a machine-learning application that enhances early arthritis detection by analyzing X-ray images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system is trained on a large dataset to automatically identify signs of arthritis, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
